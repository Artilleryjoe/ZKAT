# ZKAT
Zero-Knowledge Audit Trails (ZKAT): A lightweight, privacy-preserving, tamper-evident audit trail for security controls. Each run produces a signed digest, anchored across independent systems (Email DKIM, Git), and chained for continuity verifiers confirm proofs and anchors without ever seeing raw logs.
